The folder is organized into three subfolders:

- `scripts`: This folder contains the scripts used to generate the atmospheric emission models. 

- `profiles`: This folder contains the atmospheric profiles used as input to the `am` code. The profiles are stored as plain text files.

- `models`: This folder contains the atmosphere models generated using the profiles in the `profiles` folder. The models are stored as text files.
